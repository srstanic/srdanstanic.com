Software development can be difficult
-------------------------------------

If you have a software development team in your organization you have probably already learned that software development can be difficult.

Projects are often late, deliverables donâ€™t always meet the expectations, and other companies are poaching your best people.

And if you talk with individual team members, they might tell you that management is clueless about how the software is built. They feel that their hard work is not valued. The unreasonable expectations set by their bosses kill their motivation.

But we can make it better!
--------------------------

Obviously, there are many challenges in the software development process. I have faced many of them while managing projects for [one of the finest development agencies in New York](https://clutch.co/profile/five#reviews){:target="_blank"} and leading the product team for [one of the best DIY mobile app builders](http://www.shoutem.com/){:target="_blank"} in the world. Most of these challenges are surmountable. It may take time and effort but it always pays off in the long run.

If you are looking for help in making your software development team more efficient and reliable, I would love to hear about your struggles and help you overcome them.

In the meantime, you might be interested in a talk I gave at [Webcamp Zagreb 2015](https://2015.webcampzg.org/talks/view/inside-the-mind-of-a-development-manager/){:target="_blank"}.

I shared my experience transitioning from a development role to a management role and how my views on software development have changed over the years. The goal was to help developers better understand their managers and remove some of the friction from their collaboration. I also shared my thoughts on what makes a great developer and what makes a great leader.

I also wanted to share with you a short list of books that shaped my views on leadership and team work. Some of the ideas in these books may be far out of your or even my comfort zone. But I believe it is important to expose ourselves to new ideas and then pick and choose what feels best for our teams and organizations.
